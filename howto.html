                        <h5>Create your Website</h5>
                        <p><b>Warning: &nbsp;</b> The public github.io must not be associated with any custom domain. If you have an existing website, we suggest that you will clone your git repository into another project to avoid downtime.</p>
                        <p>In our ACenterA Portal, once you are inside a project, in the left menu you will be able to select <b>Websites</b> in the left menu. <br/> Fill in the basic information, such as the website name you want it to appear in our portal, and the https public github.io url. It should look similar to the following image:</p>

                        <h3>Step 5</h3>
                        <h5>Domain validation</h5>
                        <p>Since we may be hosing many domains, we have to validate the domain is actually your's. To do so, we ask you to add a simple TXT record for the root domain. This allow us to validate your domain and to link it with your account.</p>

                        <p>Let say the website you want to build is : <b>wwww.acentera.com</b>, you will have to create a TXT Record for acentera-websites.<b>acentera.com</b>.

                          You will have to log into your DNS Hosting provider and add the acentera-websites.<domain>.  TXT   "v=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx" as seen in the picture below.
                          <br/>

                          <br/>
                          Prior clicking the "Validate TXT", you might want to validate your TXT Record is properly. Here are two command line examples you can use.
                          <br/>
                          <br/>
                          Example using the linux Dig Command:
                          <br/><br/>
                          dig  -t txt +short  acentera-websites.acentera.com<br/>
                          "v=c4ca4238a0b923820dcc509a6f75849b"
                          <br/>

                          Example using the nslookup:
                          <br/><br/>
                          nslookup -type=TXT acentera-websites.acentera.com
                          <br/>

                          Somewhere in the answer you should see "v=c4ca4238a0b923820dcc509a6f75849b"
                          <br/>

                          <br/><b>Note:</b>In your case you will have a different hash for your own websites. Every hash are unique per accounts.<br/>

                          <br/>
                          After clicking on the Validate TXT button, if that button changes to the Following image :
                          <br/>
                          <br/>
                          We were able to successfully validate that you are the owner of that domain, and you can then click on the Create website button.
                        </p>

                        <br/>
                    </div>



                    <div class="about-us_2">
                        <h3>Step 6</h3>
                        <h5>Domain validation (Step 2)</h5>
                        <p>Once the TXT Record has successfully been validated, our website is configured and ready to be your next hosting solution.<br/>In short, if you have an active HTTP domain end-user will not notice downtime if this step is properly executed.</p>

                        <p>
                          You will have to log into your DNS Hosting provider, and this time add the CNAME entry as seen in the picture below.
                          <br/>Depending on your provider configuration, this step may take few hours.
                          <br/>
                          Prior clicking the "Validate DNS Record", you may want to validate the DNS has properly updated with your changes.
                          <br/>
                          <br/>
                          Once ready, you simply have to click on the "Validate DNS Record" and we will automatically create the SSL Certificates and assign it to your website. This step may take up to 30 seconds.
                        </p>

                        <br/>
                    </div>


                    <div class="about-us_2">
                        <h3>Success</h3>
                        <h5>Congrats!!! Share your new website.</h5>
                        <p>If you have reached this step, it means your website is not live and properly configured in our system. You may visit your new HTTP2 / HTTPS with your own custom domain website.<br></p>
                        <p>
                          After few minutes, if you have traffic to your website you will be able to see your monthly stats that refresh every 5 minutes (about) as shown in the picture below.
                        </p>
